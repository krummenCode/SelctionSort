# SelctionSort
Sort a random integer array with the selection sort algorithm.

The selection algorithm sorts an array by repeatedly finding the minimum element (considering ascending order)
from unsorted part and putting it at the beginning of a new array. The algorithm maintains two subarrays in a givin array.

1) The subarray 'Ordered' which is already sorted.
2) Remaining subarray which is unsorted.

In every iteration of selection sort, the minimum element (considering ascending order) from the unsorted subarray is picked and moved to the sorted subarray.
